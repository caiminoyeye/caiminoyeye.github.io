<li><br><p>Will you walk into my parlour?" said the Spider to the Fly,  
<p>'Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy;  
<p>The way into my parlour is up a winding stair,  
<p>And I've a many curious things to show when you are there."  
<p>Oh no, no," said the little Fly, "to ask me is in vain,  
<p>For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again." </P></li></div>

<li><br><p>"I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;  
<p>Will you rest upon my little bed?" said the Spider to the Fly.
<p>"There are pretty curtains drawn around; the sheets are fine and thin,  
<p>And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in!"  
<p>Oh no, no," said the little Fly, "for I've often heard it said,  
<p>They never, never wake again, who sleep upon your bed!" </P></li></div>

<li><br><p>Said the cunning Spider to the Fly, " Dear friend what can I do,  
<p>To prove the warm affection I 've always felt for you?  
<p>I have within my pantry, good store of all that's nice;  
<p>I'm sure you're very welcome -- will you please to take a slice?"  
<p>"Oh no, no," said the little Fly, "kind Sir, that cannot be,  
<p>I've heard what's in your pantry, and I do not wish to see!" </p></li></div>
<br><section style="font-family:Futura">    
          <div align="center"><div style="float:none;width:600px;border:10px solid purple;">
<li><br><p>"Sweet creature!" said the Spider, "you're witty and you're wise,  
<p>How handsome are your gauzy wings, how brilliant are your eyes! 
<p>I've a little looking-glass upon my parlour shelf,  
<p>If you'll step in one moment, dear, you shall behold yourself."  
<p>"I thank you, gentle sir," she said, "for what you 're pleased to say,  
<p>And bidding you good morning now, I'll call another day." </p></li></div>

<li><br><p>The Spider turned him round about, and went into his den,  
<p>For well he knew the silly Fly would soon come back again:  
<p>So he wove a subtle web, in a little corner sly,  
<p>And set his table ready, to dine upon the Fly. 
<p>Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,  
<p>"Come hither, hither, pretty Fly, with the pearl and silver wing;  
<p>Your robes are green and purple -- there's a crest upon your head;  
<p>Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead!" </p></li></div>

          <div align="center"><div style="float:none;width:600px;border:10px solid purple;">
<li><br><p>Alas, alas! how very soon this silly little Fly,  
<p>Hearing his wily, flattering words, came slowly flitting by;  
<p>With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,  
<p>Thinking only of her brilliant eyes, and green and purple hue --  
<p>Thinking only of her crested head -- poor foolish thing! At last,  
<p>Up jumped the cunning Spider, and fiercely held her fast. 
<p>He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,  
<p>Within his little parlour -- but she ne'er came out again!</p></li></div>

<li><br><p>And now dear little children, who may this story read,  
<p>To idle, silly flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed:  
<p>Unto an evil counselor, close heart and ear and eye,  
<p>And take a lesson from this tale, of the Spider and the Fly.</p></li></div>
