<h3><div><br><br><br><p>Will you walk into my parlour?" said the Spider to the Fly,
<br>'Tis the prettiest little parlour that ever you did spy;  
<br>The way into my parlour is up a winding stair,  
<br>And I've a many curious things to show when you are there."  
<br>Oh no, no," said the little Fly, "to ask me is in vain,  
<br>For who goes up your winding stair can ne'er come down again." </p></h3>
 
<h4><br><p>"I'm sure you must be weary, dear, with soaring up so high;
<br>Will you rest upon my little bed?" said the spider to the fly.
<br>"There are pretty curtains drawn around, the sheets are fine and thin,
<br>And if you like to rest awhile, I'll snugly tuck you in."
<br>"O no, no," said the little fly, "for I've often heard it said,
<br>They NEVER, NEVER WAKE again, who sleep upon YOUR bed."</p></h4>

<h5><br><p>Said the cunning spider to the fly, "Dear friend, what shall I do,
<br>To prove the warm affection I've always felt for you?
<br>I have within my pantry good store of all that's nice;
<br>I'm sure you're very welcome; will you please to take a slice?
<br>"O no, no," said the little fly, "kind sir, that cannot be;
<br>I've heard what's in your pantry, and I do not wish to see."</P></h5>

<h6><br><p>"Sweet creature!" said the spider, "you're witty and you're wise,
<br>How handsome are your gauzy wings, how brilliant are your eyes!
<br>I have a little looking-glass upon my parlor shelf,
<br>If you'll step in one moment dear, you shall behold yourself."
<br>I thank you, gentle sir," she said, "for what you're pleased to say,
<br>And bidding you good-morning NOW, I'll call ANOTHER day."</p></h6>

<h4><br><p>The spider turned him round about, and went into his den,
<br>For well he knew the silly fly would soon be back again:
<br>So he wove a subtle web, in a little corner sly,
<br>And set his table ready to dine upon the fly.
<br>Then he came out to his door again, and merrily did sing,
<br>"Come hither, hither, pretty fly, with the pearl and silver wing:
<br>Your robes are green and purple; there's a crest upon your head;
<br>Your eyes are like the diamond bright, but mine are dull as lead."</p></h7>

<h5><br><p>Alas, alas! how very soon this silly little fly,
<br>Hearing his wily flattering words, came slowly flitting by. 
<br>With buzzing wings she hung aloft, then near and nearer drew,
<br>Thinking only of her crested head - POOR FOOLISH THING! At last,
<br>Up jumped the cunning spider, and fiercely held her fast.
<br>He dragged her up his winding stair, into his dismal den,
<br>Within his little parlor; but she ne'er came out again!</p></h8>

<h6><br><p>And now, dear little children, who may this story read,
<br>To idle, silly, flattering words, I pray you ne'er give heed;
<br>Unto an evil counselor close heart, and ear, and eye,
<br>And take a lesson from this tale of the Spider and the Fly.</p></div></h9>
